I am an _Environmental Data Scientist_, Co-Leader of the [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) at the [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.bas.ac.uk) (BAS), and a Senior Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). 
I am also a Co-Director for the University of Cambridge and BAS Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the [Application of AI to the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) (AI4ER), a £6m UKRI funded programme to train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental science. 

My research group focuses on the development of AI and data science methods for understanding, monitoring and predicting environmental change. More specifically, my projects involve: 
the intelligent fusion of data from satellite and in-situ surface sensors to help understand our changing planet; 
probabilistic machine learning for localised climate impacts, including future heatwaves and water security;
deep learning frameworks for seasonal forecasting and improving climate models; 
and computer vision methods for tracking environmental change and wildlife monitoring.

The overarching aim of my research is in developing [Digital Twins of the natural environment](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environmental-monitoring-blending-satellite-and-surface-data) to improve scientific understanding and aid decision making. The digital twinning frameworks are designed to work across varying spatial and temporal scales, and geographies (from urban environments up to the Antarctic continent).

I serve on the steering committee to manage the [operational alliance](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/corporate/2020/alan-turing-institute) between The Alan Turing Institute and the UK Met Office, and as a board member for the [Cambridge Centre for Climate Science](https://www.climatescience.cam.ac.uk/).

## Studentships
As my [group](/group) has quickly grown this past year I am currently unable to take on any new Masters or PhD students. However, please feel free to reach out directly to my [science colleagues at BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/about-bas/our-organisation/our-science-teams/) if you are interested in doing a research project together with the [BAS AI Lab](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/ai). You can find information on PhD funding on our [AI4ER CDT webpage](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/).
