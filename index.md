I am an _Environmental Data Scientist_, founder and Co-Leader of the [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) at the [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.bas.ac.uk) (BAS), and a Senior Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). 
I am also a Co-Director for the University of Cambridge and BAS Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the [Application of AI to the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) (AI4ER), a £6m UKRI funded programme to train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental science. 

My research focuses on the application of AI and data science methods for understanding, monitoring and predicting environmental change.
